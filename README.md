## MySQL Database Review using Sequelize

* npm install
* npm start
* start mysql server + mysql shell

### Exercise 1

* In your database folder, create an index file.
* In your shell, create a mysql database.
* Set up Sequelize to establish a connection to the mysql database, and export the connection.

### Exercise 2

* Create a file to describe our Sequelize model schema.
* Export your schema.

### Exercise 3

* Connect your database to your controller.
* Build out your controller functionality in the server controller file.
* Use an external tool such as Postman to test your database with GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests.
* Check that the database is being updated with each request in your mysql shell.

### Exercise 4

* Create a file with some data that fits your schema, and write a function to seed that data into the database.
* Add this functionality as a setup script to your package.json and run it.
